abstract = {BACKGROUND: Given the therapeutic and prognostic importance of the unipolar-bipolar dichotomy, predicting which patients will become bipolar subsequent to index diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) is of paramount clinical significance. We sought to characterize the profile of patients with MDD who would convert to the more subtle bipolar subtype (known as BPII) on the basis of clinical and personality variables obtained during MDD episodes. METHODS: A total of 559 patients, comprehensively evaluated with the Schedule of Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia and "unipolar" MDD at entry, were administered 17 self-report personality measures. Hypomanic and manic episodes were systematically recorded over a prospective observation period of up to 11 years. We compared 48 converters to BPII (8.6{\%}) with 22 converters to bipolar I (BPI) (3.9{\%}) and the remaining larger group of unipolar patients. RESULTS: Except for greater acuteness, severity, and psychotic symptomatology, BPI converters were essentially similar to MDD nonconverters. By contrast, BPII converters were robustly distinguished from those with MDD who remained unipolar on the basis of self-report measures along the newly derived factors of Mood Lability, Energy-Activity, and Daydreaming. This profile was associated with early age at onset of MDD and pleomorphic psychopathology beyond the usual affective realm, high rates of substance abuse, as well as educational, marital, and occupational disruption and minor antisocial acts prior to discrete hypomanic episodes. Overall, BPII switchers had a more protracted and tempestuous course with shorter well intervals. "Habitual self" descriptions of temperamental instability during MDD episodes provided useful clinical information for predicting which depressed patients will switch to BPII, attaining a sensitivity of 91{\%} for all three factors combined (23 items); Mood Lability alone (nine items) was the most specific predictor (86{\%}), though of lower sensitivity (42{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: The BPII subtype is best understood by such lability intruding into, and possibly its accentuation during, depressive episodes, thereby creating an intimate interweaving of trait and state. Clinicians must note that the foregoing temperamental profile appears more fundamental in defining the affective dysregulation of the BPII subtype than hypomanic episodes emphasized in DSM-IV.},

abstract = {This new edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5?), used by clinicians and researchers to diagnose and classify mental disorders, is the product of more than 10 years of effort by hundreds of international experts in all aspects of mental health. Their dedication and hard work have yielded an authoritative volume that defines and classifies mental disorders in order to improve diagnoses, treatment, and research. The criteria are concise and explicit, intended to facilitate an objective assessment of symptom presentations in a variety of clinical settings -- inpatient, outpatient, partial hospital, consultation-liaison, clinical, private practice, and primary care. New features and enhancements make DSM-5? easier to use across all settings: ? The chapter organization reflects a lifespan approach, with disorders typically diagnosed in childhood (such as neurodevelopmental disorders) at the beginning of the manual, and those more typical of older adults (such as neurocognitive disorders) placed at the end. Also included are age-related factors specific to diagnosis. ? The latest findings in neuroimaging and genetics have been integrated into each disorder along with gender and cultural considerations.? The revised organizational structure recognizes symptoms that span multiple diagnostic categories, providing new clinical insight in diagnosis. ? Specific criteria have been streamlined, consolidated, or clarified to be consistent with clinical practice (including the consolidation of autism disorder, Asperger's syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorder into autism spectrum disorder; the streamlined classification of bipolar and depressive disorders; the restructuring of substance use disorders for consistency and clarity; and the enhanced specificity for major and mild neurocognitive disorders).? Dimensional assessments for research and validation of clinical results have been provided.? Both ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes are included for each disorder, and the organizational structure is consistent with the new ICD-11 in development. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, is the most comprehensive, current, and critical resource for clinical practice available to today's mental health clinicians and researchers of all orientations. The information contained in the manual is also valuable to other physicians and health professionals, including psychologists, counselors, nurses, and occupational and rehabilitation therapists, as well as social workers and forensic and legal specialists.},

Method: Between 1992 and 1994 we ascertained a cohort of persons with first-episode psychosis (n=168), assigning to each a consensus diagnosis. At three-year follow-up, longitudinal consensus diagnoses, blind to onset diagnoses, were made. Stability was measured by the positive predictive values (PPVs) of onset diagnoses. For onset schizophrenia, we also calculated sensitivity, specificity and concordance (kappa). Results: First-episode ICD-10 and DSM-III-R schizophrenia had a PPV of over 80{\%} at three years. Over one-third of cases with ICD-10 F20 schizophrenia at three years had non-schizophrenia diagnoses at onset. Manic psychoses showed the highest PPV (91{\%}). For onset schizophrenia, both systems had high specificity (ICD-10: 89; DSM-III-R: 93{\%}), but low sensitivity (ICD-10: 64{\%}; DSM-III-R: 51{\%}) and moderate concordance (ICD-10: 0.54; DSM-III-R: 0.46). Conclusions: Bipolar disorders and schizophrenia showed the highest stability DSM-III-R schizophrenia did not have greater stability than ICD-10 schizophrenia.

It indicates that some types of thought disorder considered important occur so infrequently as to be of little diagnostic value, such as neologisms or blocking. The traditional concept of thought disorder, which emphasizes associative loosening, is also of little value, since associative loosening occurs frequently in mania as well as in schizophrenia. This investigation demonstrates that associative loosening can no longer be considered pathognomonic of schizophrenia. On the other hand, an approach that defines various subtypes of thought disorder and uses a concept of negative-vs-positive thought disorder does often permit a distinction between mania and schizophrenia. It is recommended that the practice of referring globally to "thought disorder," as if it were homogeneous, be avoided in the future and instead that the specific subtypes occurring in particular patients be noted in both clinical practice and research.},

Evaluation of the Bleulerian perspective has been severely handicapped by the lack of any standard and widely agreed-on definition of thought disorder. Consequently, the conceptualization of thought disorder has tended to be quite diverse, and evaluation of thought disorder has tended to be quite unreliable. This report presents a set of definitions of linguistic and cognitive behaviors frequently observed in patients. These definitions derive from clinical experience, use an empirical approach, and avoid making inferences about underlying processes of thought. They attempt to define the broad range of language, thought, and communication behaviors observed in patients and are not limited to those considered characteristic of schizophrenia. The reliability of these definitions has been assessed using both tape-recorded and live interviews with patients, and it has been found to be quite good for most of the terms defined.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To analyse the time course and some risk factors for a diagnostic change from major depression to bipolar disorders (BP) over an average of 20 years from the onset of the disorders. METHODS: Patients (406) with major mood disorders hospitalised at some time between 1959 and 1963 were followed-up until 1985. The analysis also included the course prior to hospitalisation. Survival analyses and Cox regression models were applied. RESULTS: A diagnostic change from depression to bipolar I occurred in about 1{\%} of the patients per year and to bipolar II disorders in about 0.5{\%} per year. Risk factors for a change from depression to BP-I disorder were male sex and an early onset of the disorder; risk factors for a change from depression to BP-II disorder were female sex, a later onset of the disorder and a positive family history of mania. CONCLUSIONS: Across the entire lifetime, every new episode of depression brings a new risk for mania; more than half of our severe mood disorder cases became bipolars. The risk of depression developing into bipolar disorder remains constant lifelong. LIMITATIONS: The diagnostic classification of ICD-9 met RDC criteria for bipolar disorder in only 90{\%} of cases. Part of the data collected in retrospect may be less reliable; the prospective data were only collected every 5 years from 1965 to 1985 using multiple sources; mild manifestations between the follow-ups may have been partially missed. The sample of subsequent hospital admissions for major depression and mania represents a severe group of patients and generalisations to ambulatory cases may not be possible. Not all risk factors for diagnostic conversion described in the literature could be assessed in this study.},

METHODS: These trials and other recent research were considered in commenting on the design, conduct, analysis and interpretation of experimental therapeutic trials in mania and to optimize olanzapine versus placebo contrasts by systematically varying end-point criteria for mania (YMRS) and depression (HDRS) ratings. RESULTS: Olanzapine versus placebo responses were optimally separated at scores of 10 for final paired mania and depression ratings, or 5 for each rating scale considered separately. CONCLUSIONS: Use of empirically determined end-points derived from standard rating scales used in experimental therapeutics research in mood disorders can improve both outcome-assessment and separation of active treatment from placebo responses in acute mania},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: "Hostile depression" has unofficially long been described as a depressive subtype, but since DSM-III, the affect has been made a defining characteristic of borderline personality disorder. The related affect of irritability in DSM-IV-TR subsumes various hostile nuances and is included in the stem question for mood disorders--especially for hypomanic episodes; in children, it is nonetheless a sign of depression. Then, there is the unofficial more general concept of depression with anger attacks, until recently ostensibly a "unipolar" (UP) disorder. A veritable tower of Babel indeed. In the present analyses, our aim was to extend previous research on irritable-hostile depression to more specific parameters of bipolarity and depressive mixed state (DMX).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Consecutive 348 bipolar-II (BP-II) and 254 unipolar (UP) major depressive disorder (MDD) outpatients (off psychoactive agents, including substances of abuse), were interviewed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, the Hypomania Interview Guide, and the Family History Screen. Borderline personality, a confounding variable, rare in the FB setting, was excluded. Irritability was defined according to DSM-IV-TR, which includes various features of hostility and anger. Depressive mixed state (DMX) was defined as a major depressive episode (MDE) plus three or more concurrent intradepressive hypomanic symptoms, whether it occurred in BP-II or MDD.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: MDE with irritability was present in 59.7{\%} (208/348) of BP-II and in 37.4{\%} (95/254) of MDD (p=0.0000). In BP-II, MDE with, versus MDE without, irritability had significantly younger index age, higher rates of axis I comorbidity, atypical depressive features, and DMX. Upon logistic regression, we found a significant independent association between BP-II MDE with irritability and DMX. In UP, MDE with, versus without, irritability had significantly younger age and age at onset, higher rates of atypical depression, DMX, and bipolar family history. Logistic regression revealed a significant independent association between MDE with irritability and DMX. Given that we had excluded patients with borderline personality, the high prevalence of irritable-hostile depressives in this outpatient population means that hostility cannot be considered the signature of that personality. Factor analysis revealed independent "psychomotor activation" and "irritability-mental activation" factors. Odds ratios of irritability for DMX were highest in the "UP" MDD group (=12.2); for predicting DMX, irritability had the best psychometric profile of sensitivity of 66.3{\%} and a specificity of 86.1{\%} for this group as well.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nLIMITATION: We did not use specific instruments to measure irritable, hostile, and angry affects.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: These analyses show that irritable-hostile depression is distinct from agitated depression. Whether arising from a BP-II or MDD baseline, irritable-hostile depression emerges as a valid entity with strong links to external bipolar validators, such as bipolar family history. Irritable-hostile phenomenology in depression appears to be a strong clinical marker for a DMX. Irritable-hostile depression as a variant of DMX deserves the benefit of what seems to work best in practice, i.e., anticonvulsant mood stabilizers and/or atypical antipsychotics. Formal treatment studies are very much needed.},

abstract = {Background: Despite the high prevalence of bipolar spectrum disorders, most instruments currently available for the assessment of depression do not explore symptoms of 'activation' such as anger, irritability, aggressiveness, hostility, and psychomotor activation. Methods: Two samples of adults with unipolar depression were studied. They had no comorbid DSM-IV disorder, and they were free from antidepressant drugs. The first sample (n=380) was assessed with the SVARAD, a validated scale for the rapid assessment of the main psychopathological dimensions. The second sample (n=143) was assessed with the MMPI-2. Factor analysis was performed on SVARAD items and MMPI-2 clinical scales. Results: In both samples, we obtained a three-factor solution with factors interpreted as a depressive dimension, an anxious dimension, and an activation dimension. The latter dimension appeared to be clinically relevant in 20-27{\%} of patients. Limitations: The presence of a comorbid disorder may have been missed in some cases. Also, some bipolar II patients might have been misdiagnosed as unipolar and included in the study. Further, our findings apply only to a selected psychiatric population, and it should be tested whether they generalize to other settings of care and other countries. Conclusions: Our results suggest that depressive mixed states are not rare even in patients diagnosed as unipolar, and that some unipolar patients might actually be 'pseudounipolar' and belong to the bipolar spectrum. More in general, our findings suggest that some depressed patients have prominent symptoms of activation that can easily go unnoticed using instruments that do not explore such symptoms. Detecting these symptoms has important treatment implications. © 2002 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis can prolong the suffering of patients with bipolar disorder. Accurate early diagnosis is sometimes difficult, however, particularly because patients often present in the depressive phase, which can easily be mistaken for unipolar depression. Unfortunately, therapy appropriate for unipolar depression can increase the risk of manic switch or cycle acceleration in bipolar disorder, especially in those with a family history of bipolarity and suicide, although some antidepressants may be useful in some bipolar patients. In addition, most currently available mood stabilizers, though effective in managing mania, do not effectively resolve depression. In contrast, lamotrigine has shown activity in bipolar depression and has a very low risk of manic switch. Bipolar depression, compared with unipolar depression, is more likely to be associated with hypersomnia, motor retardation, mood lability, early onset, and a family history of bipolar disorder. Awareness of these distinctions can greatly improve diagnosis of bipolar disorder and provide an opportunity for effective therapeutic intervention. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Continued research efforts aim to elucidate the heterogeneity in depression. The identification of meaningful and valid subtypes has implications for research and clinical practice. Based on patterns of depressive symptomatology, this study identified a typology of depressive syndromes using data from a large, nationally representative survey.

METHODS: Analyses were based on a subsample of 12,180 respondents from the 2001-2002 Wave of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). Latent class analysis was applied to the DSM-IV 'A' criteria for major depression to identify homogenous subtypes or classes of depressive syndromes. Associations between the emergent latent classes and demographic and clinical characteristics were assessed.

RESULTS: Three clinically relevant subtypes were identified, in addition to a class who reported few depressive symptoms: severely depressed (40.9{\%}), psychosomatic (30.6{\%}), cognitive-emotional (10.2{\%}) and non-depressed (18.3{\%}). The odds of experiencing negative life events, psychiatric disorders, and having a family background of major depression were significantly higher for the severely depressed, psychosomatic and cognitive-emotional classes, compared to the non-depressed class. Several unique differences between the latent classes also emerged.

LIMITATIONS: Methodological shortcomings included: reliance on lay interviewer-administered structured interviews to determine diagnoses; basing sample selection on the endorsement of screener items; and, using measures of 'any anxiety disorder', 'any mood disorder', and 'any personality disorder' to determine psychiatric disorder prevalence rates.

CONCLUSIONS: Significant heterogeneity in depressive symptomatology exists in this U.S. sample. Profiling symptom patterns is potentially useful as a first step in developing tailored intervention and treatment programmes.},

The role of somatic symptoms was analyzed in relation to the unipolar-bipolar division, Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) subtypes, hypersomnia, and appetite increase. The data suggest that the rate and level of somatic symptoms increased with the severity of depression and age, only appetite loss differentiated unipolar from bipolar patients, and the classic somatic symptoms of depression were present in most RDC subtypes and not exclusively associated with the "endogenous" subtype. Hypersomnia or increased appetite identified two overlapping depressive subgroups; patients in both groups were young and characterized by high interpersonal sensitivity. Hypersomniac depressed patients were less anxious and agitated; patients with increased appetite were more hostile and showed a greater decrease in libido than age-matched and sex-matched patients with neither symptom.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study examined the prevalence of irritability in patients with bipolar I disorder during an episode of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) major depression who do not meet criteria for a mixed episode. METHOD: A chart review of 111 patients with bipolar I disorder treated at the Massachusetts General Hospital Bipolar Clinic between 1998 and 2000 identified 34 patients who met criteria for a DSM-IV major depressive episode in the absence of (1) mood elevation and/or (2) irritability associated with any additional above threshold DSM-IV symptoms of mania. Data gathered from the charts utilized prospective ratings made routinely at each clinic visit using the Clinical Monitoring Form (CMF), a structured assessment instrument which includes modified versions of the mood modules of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Data from these 34 patients were reviewed to determine the presence of irritability. RESULTS: The frequency of abnormal irritability in these 34 patients followed a bimodal distribution: 26{\%} of the patients showed abnormal irritability > or =75{\%} of the time, compared with 68{\%} of the patients with abnormal irritability < or =30{\%} of the time. Of the high-irritability patients, psychomotor agitation was rated as definitely present to a significant degree in 44{\%}. Talkativeness and distractibility were rated present but subthreshold in one patient each. All other symptoms of DSM-IV mania were absent. CONCLUSION: Approximately 25{\%} of patients with bipolar I disorder who meet criteria for a DSM-IV major depressive episode also experienced substantial irritability in the absence of associated symptoms of mania. Our results suggest that abnormal irritability is not limited to mania or mixed states.},

@article{Faludi2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although we have several self-report instruments available to assess depression, they yield a composite score and thus do not allow for the differential examination of major symptom clusters associated with depression. However, such an instrument would be a useful tool in subtyping depression and selecting the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for each patient. The neurocircuitry theory describes the biochemical and neuroanatomic background associated with the major symptoms of depression. Based on the neurocircuitry theory, our team has developed a new instrument, the Depression Profile, to selectively assess depressive symptom clusters associated with different neurotransmitter systems and neuroanatomic structures. The aim of our study was to investigate the psychometric characteristics of Depression Profile.

METHODS: 339 patients consecutively admitted with DSM-IV major depression in our hospital completed the Depression Profile in the first two weeks of their hospitalisation. 81 patients in an adult outpatient unit also completed the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale. Internal consistency of Depression Profile was tested with item analysis. The external validity of Depression Profile against the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale was tested using Pearson correlations.

RESULTS: The internal consistency of Depression Profile proved to be excellent. The Cronbach alpha values of the scales met the expectable minimum level derived from the number of items in the scales. In testing for convergent validity, all Pearson correlation coefficients between Depression profile subscales and the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale were significant and moderate to high which indicates the good external validity of our instrument.

DISCUSSION: The initial psychometric evaluation of Depression Profile indicates that our instrument has good reliability and internal and external validity. The instrument also proved to be useful in clinical work to aid the choice of medications and determine the subtype of depressive episodes. Further studies, possibly with biochemical and neuroimaging methodology are needed to validate the 9 main symptom clusters of the Depression Profile subscales with respect to their neuroanatomical and neurochemical bases.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The short-term diagnostic stability of schizophrenic and other psychotic disorders was examined in first-admission patients, with attention to the principal reasons for diagnostic change. METHOD: Hospitalized first-admission patients (N = 278) participating in an epidemiologic study were interviewed at baseline and after 6 months with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R. A best estimate diagnosis was made at both time points with the use of all available sources of information. Reasons for changes in diagnosis were determined by two psychiatrists. RESULTS: Affective psychosis and schizophrenic disorders were relatively stable broad diagnostic categories over the 6-month period, with 86.5{\%}-88.9{\%} of the patients remaining in the same category, although findings for specific diagnoses within these categories ranged from 61.5{\%} to 85.7{\%}. The groups with unknown and nonspecific diagnoses showed less stability; the diagnoses of more than one-third of these patients remained unknown or nonspecific at the 6-month evaluation. If the 6-month diagnoses are used as the research standard, somewhat lower percentages of patients received the same diagnoses at baseline. Forty-three percent of the changes in diagnosis were attributed to the clinical course of illness; the rest were attributed to the diagnostic process itself. CONCLUSIONS: A longitudinal diagnostic assessment based on multiple sources of information is crucial for categorizing first-admission psychotic patients, particularly those who do not initially fit into a DSM-III-R category. The short-term stability of a diagnosis is a function of multiple factors, including the changing clinical picture, additional sources of information, and new interpretations of original data.},

Past diagnostic and treatment information was obtained by patient report and systematic psychiatric history. Bipolar diagnosis was based on DSM-IV criteria using a SCID-based interview. RESULTS: Bipolar disorder was found to be misdiagnosed as unipolar depression in 37{\%} of patients who first see a mental health professional after their first manic/hypomanic episode. Antidepressants were used earlier and more frequently than mood stabilizers, and 23{\%} of this unselected sample experienced a new or worsening rapid-cycling course attributable to antidepressant use.

They were then treated according to systematic structured interview diagnoses. These data reflect the changes in diagnoses and treatment. Results: 40{\%} (19/48) were identified with previously undiagnosed bipolar disorder, all previously diagnosed with unipolar major depressive disorder. A period of 7.5±9.8 years elapsed in this group before bipolar diagnosis was made. Antidepressant use was high on admission (38{\%}) and was reduced with acceptable treatment response rates.

Limitations: While diagnoses: were made prospectively, treatment response was assessed retrospectively, and was based on non-randomized, naturalistic therapy. Conclusions: Systematic application of DSM-IV criteria identified previously undiagnosed bipolar disorder in 40{\%} of a referred population of patients with mood disorders, all previously misdiagnosed as unipolar major depressive disorder.

This prospective follow-up study examined longitudinal outcome in a large group of inpatients with affective disorders. METHOD: Fifty-one bipolar manic patients and 49 unipolar depressed patients were interviewed three times: 1) during hospitalization, 2) approximately 2 years after discharge, and 3) approximately 4.5 years after discharge. Subjects were treated under routine conditions and assessed for global adjustment, rehospitalization, and work and social functioning. RESULTS: Only 41{\%} of the bipolar group had a good overall outcome by the time of the 4.5-year follow-up. The bipolar patients had more severe work impairment than the unipolar group. More than one-half of the bipolar patients were rehospitalized at least once during the 4.5-year follow-up period. Outcome for both diagnostic groups improved significantly over time. CONCLUSIONS: Many contemporary bipolar patients demonstrate gradual improvement in the first several years after hospitalization. However, a subgroup approaching 60{\%} still experience poor posthospital adjustment in one or more areas of functioning.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk for subsequent development of mania or hypomania, the authors conducted a 15-year prospective follow-up study of a large, young cohort of patients originally hospitalized for unipolar major depression. METHOD: Patients who were hospitalized for unipolar major depression (N=74; mean age=23.0 years, SD=3.8) were assessed prospectively as inpatients and then followed up five times over 15 years, at approximately 2, 5, 8, 11, and 15 years after discharge. Manic or hypomanic episodes, medications, and rehospitalizations were determined by standardized assessments at each follow-up. Polarity conversions were evaluated by survival analyses. RESULTS: By the 15-year follow-up, 27{\%} of the study group had developed one or more distinct periods of hypomania, while another 19{\%} had at least one episode of full bipolar I mania. Depressed patients with psychosis at the index depressive episode were significantly more likely than nonpsychotic patients to demonstrate subsequent mania or hypomania at follow-up. Those with family histories of bipolar illness showed a nonsignificantly higher rate of switching to mania or hypomania. Spontaneous and antidepressant-associated manias did not differ in frequency. Fewer than one-half of the patients who showed an eventual bipolar course had received prescriptions for mood stabilizers in any follow-up year. CONCLUSIONS: Young depressed inpatients with psychotic features may be at especially high risk for eventually developing mania. The probability for developing a bipolar spectrum disorder increases in linear fashion for patients at risk for polarity conversion during the first 10-15 years after an index depressive episode.},

abstract = {The revolution in psychiatry that began in earnest in the 1960s led to dramatic advances in the understanding and treatment of manic-depressive illness. Hailed as the most outstanding book in the biomedical sciences when it was originally published in 1990, Manic-Depressive Illness was the first to survey this massive body of evidence comprehensively and to assess its meaning for both clinician and scientist. It also vividly portrayed the experience of manic-depressive illness from the perspective of patients, their doctors, and researchers. Encompassing an understanding about the illness as Kraeplin conceived of it- about its cyclical course and about the essential unity of its bipolar and recurrent unipolar forms- the book has become the definitive work on the topic, revered by both specialists and nonspecialists alike. Now, in this magnificent second edition, Drs. Frederick Goodwin and Kay Redfield Jamison bring their unique contribution to mental health science into the 21st century. In collaboration with a team of other leading scientists, a collaboration designed to preserve the unified voice of the two authors, they exhaustively review the biological and genetic literature that has dominated the field in recent years and incorporate cutting-edge research conducted since publication of the first edition. They also update their surveys of psychological and epidemiological evidence, as well as that pertaining to diagnostic issues, course, and outcome, and they offer practical guidelines for differential diagnosis and clinical management. The medical treatment of manic and depressive episodes is described, strategies for preventing future episodes are given in detail, and psychotherapeutic issues common in this illness are considered. Special emphasis is given to fostering compliance with medication regimens and treating patients who abuse drugs and alcohol or who pose a risk of suicide. This book, unique in the way that it retains the distinct perspective of its authors while assuring the maximum in-depth coverage of a vastly expanded base of scientific knowledge, will be a valuable and necessary addition to the libraries of psychiatrists and other physicians, psychologists, clinical social workers, neuroscientists, pharmacologists, and the patients and families who live with manic-depressive illness.},

abstract = {Objective:  To determine whether men and women with bipolar disorder differ in age of onset, course of illness, number of suicide attempts, comorbidity rates and symptom presentation. Method:  Data were collected from 211 (121 women; 90 men) adults using the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies, medical records, and additional information gathered from relatives. Results:  Most gender comparisons showed no evidence of differences. Nonetheless, more men than women reported mania at the onset of bipolar I disorder. Men also had higher rates of comorbid alcohol abuse/dependence, cannabis abuse/dependence, pathological gambling and conduct disorder. Men were more likely to report ‘behavioural problems’ and ‘being unable to hold a conversation’ during mania. Women reported higher rates of comorbid eating disorders, and weight change, appetite change and middle insomnia during depression. Conclusions:  Men and women were generally similar in their symptom presentation, age of onset of bipolar disorder, and in the total number of mood episodes. However, they differed in the type of episode at onset and comorbidity patterns.},

@article{Keitner1996,
abstract = {The objective of the current study was to better understand the nature of prodromal and residual symptoms of mania and depression, as reported by patients with bipolar I disorder and their family members. Prodromal and residual symptoms of mania and depression were elicited from 74 patients with bipolar I disorder. In 45 cases, an adult family member provided similar information. Three clinicians classified the symptoms into six broad categories: behavioral, cognitive, mood, neurovegetative, social, and other. The clinicians also categorized symptoms as typical or idiosyncratic. Seventy-eight percent of the patients reported prodromal depressive symptoms and 87{\%} reported prodromal manic symptoms; greater than half of the patients disclosed residual symptoms of depression (54{\%}) and mania (68{\%}). Within each of these four illness categories, cognitive symptoms were consistently the most common symptoms reported by patients. A substantial number of symptoms were idiosyncratic, particularly those reported for residual depression. Agreement between patient and family members on reported symptoms was strong for the prodromal phase of both polarities, but less so for the residual phases. These preliminary results suggest that patients with bipolar I disorder and their family members can identify prodromal and residual symptoms, that these symptoms are quite common, and that prodromal symptoms may be more prevalent or easier to identify than residual symptoms. Cognitive symptoms were consistently the most common symptoms reported by patients.},

A significant reduction of the mean number of morbid episodes and of the mean total morbidity during lithium treatment was observed only in patients with a previous MDI or IRR course. The percentage of responders to prophylaxis was significantly different among the five groups, and the difference could be mainly ascribed to the high response rate in the MDI group and the low response rate in the DMI and CC-RC groups.

abstract = {Much of the scientific literature on affective states in primary care settings is derived from instrument-based diagnoses, typically without the benefit of clinical in-depth examination. In a naturalistic family practice setting, we prospectively evaluated 108 consecutive anxious and/or depressed patients. All diagnoses derived from semistructured interviews conducted by a family physician with enhanced training in mood disorders. Nonbipolar depressions were found in 60 of 108 patients (55.6{\%}), nearly half of whom were in the depression not otherwise specified (DNOS) category; yet on careful history, all but two of 28 DNOS cases had major depressive episodes in the past. Twenty-eight patients (25.9{\%}) were diagnosed with bipolar I, II, or III disorder or cyclothymia. Panic disorder was found in 9{\%}, and obsessive-compulsive disorder and active chemical dependency were each diagnosed in 3{\%}. Bipolar spectrum disorders were common (one in three within the depressive group) and at times were not recognized until several weeks or months into the treatment phase of the depressed or anxious state. Although the largest percentage of patients had DNOS at the index episode, bipolar illness (usually bipolar II) was also common. Our findings contrast with the nearly total unipolarity reported in the instrument-based (nonclinician) literature. If generalizable, our observations have significant implications for physician education and practice, since bipolar depressions require different interventions. Further investigation to explore interview approaches and/or instruments sensitive for hypomania and other "soft" bipolar features seems warranted.},

With regard to the whole course, 148 patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of schizophrenic, 106 of affective and 101 of schizoaffective disorders. Patients with a schizophrenic initial episode showed the greatest stability: 90{\%} had no other type of episode. The majority of patients who suffered a melancholic initial episode remained unipolar melancholics or developed manic symptomatology, and only a few suffered schizoaffective or schizophrenic episodes. Patients with a manic symptomatology at the beginning had a very unstable and changeable course. The stability of patients with initial schizodepressive episodes lay between that of patients with melancholic initial episodes and that of those with manic initial episodes. The findings demonstrate the relevance of longitudinal considerations in making the final diagnosis.},

The number of episodes and cycles were found to be independent from premorbid and sociodemographic variables. But a significant relation was found between number of episodes (and cycles) and (a) polarity of the affective symptomatology, (b) presence of psychotic productive symptoms, (c) polymorphous course, (d) age at onset, and (e) duration of activity of the illness.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mental health service providers have seen an increased need for demonstrating symptom reductions during the past decade. This change has been particularly evident to those working in inpatient psychiatry facilities where there is considerable need for a brief, easily administered, and low-cost means of tracking symptom change. The current study evaluated the utility of using the Symptom Checklist-90 Revised for tracking symptom reductions in patients admitted to rural adolescent and adult psychiatry units. METHOD: Consecutive admissions to adolescent (N = 104) and adult (N = 125) psychiatry units located in a rural community hospital served as subjects. The mean length of stay was 8 days for adolescents and 7 days for adults. Patients were administered the Symptom Checklist-90 Revised at admission and just prior to discharge. Psychiatrists provided a DSM-IV primary diagnosis for each patient. RESULTS: Principal component analyses on both the adolescent and adult admission and discharge Symptom Checklist-90 Revised subscales resulted in a 1-factor solution. Repeated-measures ANOVAs demonstrated the Global Severity Index to be a sensitive measure of clinically significant admission-to-discharge symptom change. Analyses using psychiatrist-assigned diagnoses revealed that all diagnostic categories evinced significant admission-to-discharge symptom reductions. DISCUSSION: Implications for using the Symptom Checklist-90 Revised to evaluate clinically significant symptom changes on rural inpatient psychiatry units are discussed.},

abstract = {A large number of rating scales have been devised to assess the clinical construct of 'depression'. These scales have been universally used in research with little consideration of their content, or how they relate to accepted definitions of depressive disorder. The scales are often arbitrarily selected and used for the study on the assumption that all measure the same construct. The item analysis of a number of the most widely used depression scales reveals a variation in the areas of psychopathology they cover; some scales place greater emphasis upon the assessment of anxiety than upon depressed mood. Since disturbance in neurobiological systems is manifest by specific aspects of affective and behavioural malfunction, and since psychodynamic factors lead to particular cognitive sets, the advancement of research will depend upon the construction and validation of more refined measures than are provided by the present approach.},

Bipolar II patients had significantly more previous episodes (P = .001), including both depressive (P = .003) and hypomanic (P = .006) switches, but had been hospitalized (P = .001) and presented psychotic symptoms (P < .001) less frequently.

abstract = {Psychopathological syndromes, as originally revealed by clinical observation, can also be detected by multivariate statistical analyses of symptom ratings. Changes in the course of psychiatric syndromes may be rated simply by improvement scales or by consecutive quantifications of symptoms and their comparison in chronological order. For the latter approach, which is less liable to bias, clinical ratings of psychopathology by staff members, self-ratings by the patients, analyses of patients' overt behavior (including video and speech records), or objective measurements of psychological and/or physiological variables can be used. Advantages and limitations of these different methods are discussed and illustrated by examples from ongoing clinical research in affective disorders. Generally, the combined use of different rating procedures is recommended. Self-ratings are economical, but they may represent aspects of psychopathology other than clinical ratings. In endogenous depression, mood scales are valid (supplementary) tools for the quantification of long-term as well as short-term changes, including diurnal variations. In severe conditions of mania, however, clinical rating has been--until now--the only valid basis for quantifying the degree of psychopathology and its changes with time. Precise evaluation of changes in psychopathology is essential in longitudinal investigations of endogenous affective disorders, since psychopathology up to now seems to have been the most sensitive and the most specific indicator of the hypothetical underlying abnormalities of cerebral functioning.},

abstract = {Introducci{\'{o}}n: Los trastornos del estado del {\'{a}}nimo son los m{\'{a}}s prevalentes en nuestro pa{\'{\i}}s; sin embargo no se cuenta con un instrumento validado tipo autoreporte para medir la sintomatolog{\'{\i}}a maniaca, por lo que nos propusimos como objetivo de desarrollar y validar una escala de autoreporte basados en la escala para man{\'{\i}}a de la Universidad Nacional (EMUN). Materiales y M{\'{e}}todos: Estudio psicom{\'{e}}trico, descriptivo y correlacional. Dise{\~{n}}o transversal. Se evaluaron 150 pacientes con diagn{\'{o}}stico de trastorno afectivo bipolar con episodio hipomaniaco, maniaco, depresivo o mixto, aplicando la EMUN II y la versi{\'{o}}n de autoreporte (AR) donde se calificaron 3 subescalas: Frecuencia, Intensidad, y grado de Molestia de cada uno de los 26 {\'{\i}}tems. Para el an{\'{a}}lisis factorial se tomaron los 150 pacientes; para la confiabilidad test-retest se realiz{\'{o}} con 29 pacientes agudos, para la sensibilidad al cambio y la validez de convergencia se realiz{\'{o}} con 33 de los pacientes. Resultados: Se delimitaron 3 factores que fueron: activaci{\'{o}}n, depresi{\'{o}}n, disf{\'{o}}rico-mixto; mostraron adecuados niveles de consistencia interna, as{\'{\i}} como adecuados puntajes en la confiablidad del test-retest seg{\'{u}}n el coeficiente de correlaci{\'{o}}n de concordancia de Lin, la sensibilidad al cambio y la validez de convergencia seg{\'{u}}n el coeficiente de correlaci{\'{o}}n de Pearson entre la escala para man{\'{\i}}a de la Universidad Nacional EMUN y la versi{\'{o}}n AR. Discusi{\'{o}}n y Conclusiones: Se desarroll{\'{o}} una escala con 26 {\'{\i}}tems y tres calificaciones para cada uno evaluando los s{\'{\i}}ntomas maniacos, siendo esta hasta lo encontrado en la literatura la primera desarrollada y validada en poblaci{\'{o}}n hispanoparlante latina, con adecuados par{\'{a}}metros psicom{\'{e}}tricos siendo confiable y consistente.},

abstract = {Los diagn{\'{o}}sticos en psiquiatr{\'{\i}}a son fundamentalmente basados en el juicio cl{\'{\i}}nico, no existiendo pruebas diagn{\'{o}}sticas de laboratorio, por esta raz{\'{o}}n en los {\'{u}}ltimos a{\~{n}}os se ha intentado hacer m{\'{a}}s objetivo este proceso por medio de las escalas de evaluaci{\'{o}}n. La Escala para Man{\'{\i}}a de la Universidad Nacional de Colombia (EMUN), originalmente desarrollado en poblaci{\'{o}}n hispanoparlante, es un instrumento dise{\~{n}}ado para medir el s{\'{\i}}ndrome maniaco. El objetivo de la presente investigaci{\'{o}}n es mejorar el instrumento EMUN para permitir una evaluaci{\'{o}}n integral del s{\'{\i}}ndrome man{\'{\i}}aco, incorporando y modificando {\'{\i}}tems que suplan las deficiencias en el rango de medici{\'{o}}n en los s{\'{\i}}ntomas correspondientes al s{\'{\i}}ndrome depresivo, deficiencias encontradas en estudios previos. Se evaluaron 301 pacientes con diagn{\'{o}}stico de episodio maniaco, mixto o depresivo. Se analizaron las caracter{\'{\i}}sticas psicom{\'{e}}tricas del estudio encontr{\'{a}}ndose en los resultados una estructura de tres dominios: Activaci{\'{o}}n ps{\'{\i}}quica y auton{\'{o}}mica, Depresi{\'{o}}n, Activaci{\'{o}}n motora y labilidad emocional. No se encontraron diferencias significativas entre los puntajes de la escala por diagn{\'{o}}stico, lo cual indicar{\'{\i}}a que {\'{e}}ste es un instrumento que detecta intensidad del atributo, independientemente de que el paciente se encuentre en una de las categor{\'{\i}}as de la enfermedad maniaco depresiva. Se podr{\'{\i}}a concluir que la escala refleja una estructura de dominios que es cl{\'{\i}}nicamente plausible, se evidencia que es un instrumento {\'{u}}til para medir el cambio de la condici{\'{o}}n cl{\'{\i}}nica, y finalmente la incorporaci{\'{o}}n de {\'{\i}}tems del espectro depresivo contribuye a la medici{\'{o}}n valida y confiable del s{\'{\i}}ndrome maniaco depresivo.},

abstract = {Introducci{\&}oacute;n. La escala para man{\&}iacute;as de la Universidad Nacional de Colombia es un instrumento dise{\&}ntilde;ado para medir la gravedad de la sintomatolog{\&}iacute;a man{\&}iacute;aca y s{\&}oacute;lo ha sido validada utilizando t{\&}eacute;cnicas de teor{\&}iacute;a psicom{\&}eacute;trica cl{\&}aacute;sica. Objetivos. Determinar las propiedades psicom{\&}eacute;tricas y las caracter{\&}iacute;sticas, como instrumento de medici{\&}oacute;n, de la escala para man{\&}iacute;as mediante an{\&}aacute;lisis basados en la teor{\&}iacute;a de respuesta al {\&}iacute;tem. Materiales y m{\&}eacute;todos. Se evaluaron 264 pacientes con diagn{\&}oacute;stico de episodio man{\&}iacute;aco, hipoman{\&}iacute;aco o mixto, usando la escala para man{\&}iacute;as. Se analizaron las caracter{\&}iacute;sticas psicom{\&}eacute;tricas del instrumento utilizando un modelo de Rasch de cr{\&}eacute;dito parcial para datos polit{\&}oacute;micos. Resultados. El an{\&}aacute;lisis mostr{\&}oacute; que, en contraste con los {\&}iacute;tems, los {\&}iacute;ndices de separaci{\&}oacute;n y la confiabilidad para personas fueron bajos, lo cual sugiere una posible representaci{\&}oacute;n reducida del constructo evaluado en esta muestra. La disminuci{\&}oacute;n de la necesidad de dormir fue el {\&}iacute;tem m{\&}aacute;s f{\&}aacute;cilmente detectable en los pacientes man{\&}iacute;acos. La mayor{\&}iacute;a de {\&}iacute;tems se ajust{\&}oacute; a las expectativas del modelo (excepto el afecto depresivo y la capacidad de distraerse). El diagn{\&}oacute;stico de la escala de puntuaci{\&}oacute;n mostr{\&}oacute; que las medidas promedio se incrementan monot{\&}oacute;nicamente a trav{\&}eacute;s de la escala. Dos {\&}iacute;tems mostraron redundancia y podr{\&}iacute;an omitirse en versiones futuras de la escala. El mapa persona-{\&}iacute;tem sugiere que el s{\&}iacute;ndrome no queda completamente evaluado por la escala, probablemente debido a que algunos s{\&}iacute;ntomas depresivos no se incluyeron en ella. Conclusiones. En este primer estudio de la escala para man{\&}iacute;as usando el an{\&}aacute;lisis de Rasch, se detect{\&}oacute; mal ajuste y redundancia de algunos {\&}iacute;tems. El s{\&}iacute;ndrome man{\&}iacute;aco no queda completamente evaluado por la escala. El instrumento podr{\&}iacute;a mejorarse agregando s{\&}iacute;ntomas depresivos.},
